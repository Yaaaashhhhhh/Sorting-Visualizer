# Sorting-Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer is a web application built using React that offers an interactive and visual representation of various sorting algorithms. This project aims to provide users with a better understanding of how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process on a visual canvas.

Features
1-Visualization of Sorting Algorithms: Users can see how sorting algorithms rearrange elements in real-time, providing a clear visual understanding of the algorithm's behavior.
2-Adjustable Array Size: Users can control the size of the array to be sorted, allowing them to visualize sorting algorithms on different scales.
3-Random Array Generation: With a single click, users can generate a random array of integers to be sorted, providing a convenient way to test different sorting algorithms.
4-Multiple Sorting Algorithms: The Sorting Visualizer supports various sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort, allowing users to compare the performance and behavior of different algorithms.

How It Works
1-Generate Array: Users can click on the "Generate New Array" button to create a new random array with a specified number of elements.
2-Choose Sorting Algorithm: After generating an array, users can select a sorting algorithm from the available options, such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, or Bubble Sort.
3-Visualize Sorting: Once a sorting algorithm is selected, users can click on the corresponding button to start the sorting process. The Sorting Visualizer animates the sorting algorithm's execution, visually showing how elements are swapped, compared, and rearranged until the array is sorted.
4-Analyze Results: Users can observe how different sorting algorithms perform on arrays of varying sizes and compositions, gaining insights into each algorithm's efficiency, speed, and behavior.
